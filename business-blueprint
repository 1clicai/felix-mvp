BUSINESS BLUEPRINT

Token-Based Ecommerce Management Platform

One platform. One dashboard. Pay only for what you use.

February 2026

CONFIDENTIAL

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

We are entering the era of Prompted Personalized Software (PPS) — where businesses stop adapting to software and software adapts to them. Business OS is the first platform built entirely around this principle for non-technical entrepreneurs. It is a token-based SaaS platform that empowers any business owner to build, deploy, and manage their entire operation from a single, unified dashboard — through natural language prompts, with zero coding required. The platform replaces 6–12 month implementation cycles and fragmented tooling with one elegant foundation powered by a prepaid token economy.

The Core Idea

You build custom ecommerce apps for clients. Clients pay for tokens to run those apps. Everything is managed in one place. No per-seat pricing, no surprise invoices — just simple, transparent usage-based billing.

Problem | Ecommerce businesses juggle 5–10 disconnected tools: store builders, order managers, analytics dashboards, email tools, inventory systems. It's expensive, fragmented, and inefficient.

Solution | A unified platform where the founder builds tailored apps for each client, and clients manage everything through one dashboard — paying only for the tokens their apps consume.

Revenue Model | Token packs sold upfront. Recurring token subscriptions. Optional app-build service fees. White-label licensing for agencies.

Target Market | Non-technical business owners across all revenue stages — restaurateurs, service providers, online sellers, coaches, consultants, and retailers — who are building or scaling an online presence and need a complete operational platform without an engineering team.

BUSINESS MODEL

How It Works

The platform operates on three distinct layers that work together to create a seamless experience for both the founder (you) and the client.

Layer | Description | Owner
1. App Building | You build custom apps tailored to each client's ecommerce needs using your platform's internal tooling. | 
2. Dashboard Access | Clients get access to a unified dashboard where all their apps live and can be managed in one place. | 
3. Token Consumption | Every action within the apps (syncing orders, generating reports, sending notifications, etc.) consumes tokens from the client's balance. | 

Revenue Streams

The business generates revenue through four complementary channels:

Revenue Stream | Description | Pricing Model
Token Packs (Pay-as-you-go) | Clients purchase token bundles upfront and consume them at their own pace across all their apps. | $29 / 5,000 tokens$79 / 15,000 tokens$199 / 50,000 tokens
Token Subscriptions | Monthly auto-renewing token plans with a discount vs one-time packs. Ensures predictable recurring revenue. | $49/mo — 10,000 tokens$129/mo — 30,000 tokens$299/mo — 80,000 tokens
App Build Fees | One-time service fee to build and deploy a custom app for a client within the platform. | $500–$2,500 per app
White-Label Licensing | Agencies or resellers can license the platform under their own brand to serve their own clients. | $299–$999/month

Token Economy Design

The token system is the heartbeat of the platform. It must be intuitive, transparent, and valuable to the client.

Feature | Details
What costs tokens? | Order sync, product updates, automated reports, notification sends, API calls, AI features
What's free? | Dashboard login, viewing data, manual edits, support chat
Token rollover? | Unused tokens roll over for 90 days (subscription) or 12 months (one-time pack)
Token transparency | Clients see a real-time token usage meter and breakdown per app in their dashboard
Low balance alerts | Automatic email/SMS alert at 20% balance remaining — with 1-click top-up
Bonus tokens | 10% bonus tokens for referrals, annual plans, or high-volume usage milestones

PLATFORM & PRODUCT

Core Platform Features

The platform has two interfaces: the Client Dashboard (what clients see) and the Founder Console (what you use to build and manage everything).

Client Dashboard

Unified view of all apps, products, and orders in one place

Real-time token balance meter with usage breakdown per app

Order management: view, filter, update, and fulfill orders

Product catalog management: edit listings, inventory, pricing

Analytics: sales trends, top products, customer insights

Notification center: track app activity and platform announcements

One-click token top-up and subscription management

Founder Console (Admin)

App builder: create, configure, and deploy client apps

Client manager: onboard clients, assign apps, set token costs per action

Token ledger: view all token transactions across all clients

Revenue dashboard: MRR, churn, token velocity, top clients

White-label settings: configure branding for agency clients

Support system: ticket management and live chat

App Types You Can Build

Apps are modular units that live inside the client dashboard. Each app serves a specific business function and consumes tokens per use.

App Name | Function | Token Cost
Order Sync App | Syncs orders from Shopify, WooCommerce, Amazon, etc. into one unified feed. | 5–15 tokens per sync
Inventory Manager | Tracks stock levels, alerts on low inventory, auto-updates across channels. | 3–10 tokens per update
Report Generator | Generates weekly/monthly sales, returns, and profit reports. | 20–50 tokens per report
Email Automator | Sends order confirmations, shipping updates, and re-engagement emails. | 2–5 tokens per email
AI Product Describer | Uses AI to write or improve product descriptions at scale. | 10–25 tokens per description
Customer Insights App | Segments customers by behavior, LTV, and purchase frequency. | 30–80 tokens per analysis

GO-TO-MARKET STRATEGY

Target Customer Profile

Attribute | Profile
Business Type | DTC ecommerce brands, dropshippers, Amazon/Etsy sellers, boutique retailers
Annual Revenue | Any revenue stage — from early-stage founders to established businesses. No upper limit: the platform scales with the business.
Team Size | 1–10 people (mostly solo founders or small teams)
Pain Point | Paying for features they never use, adapting their process to rigid software, and waiting months for customizations that should take minutes.
Tech Comfort | Moderate — comfortable with dashboards but not with code or API setups
Location | Initially Colombia + Latin America; expand to US and global markets

Acquisition Channels

Channel | Tactic
Direct Outreach | Reach out to ecommerce sellers on Instagram, TikTok, and LinkedIn. Offer a free app build + 5,000 free tokens to first 20 clients.
Content Marketing | YouTube and TikTok tutorials on ecommerce operations, tool comparisons, and time-saving automations — positioning the platform as the solution.
Community Presence | Join and contribute to ecommerce Facebook Groups, Reddit communities (r/ecommerce), and Discord servers.
Referral Program | Give clients 10% bonus tokens for each referral that signs up and purchases tokens.
Agency Partnerships | Partner with ecommerce agencies that serve multiple clients — offer white-label licensing.
App Marketplace | Eventually list on Shopify App Store, WooCommerce directory, and similar platforms.

Pricing Positioning

The platform is positioned as the affordable, flexible alternative to stacking multiple SaaS tools. The token model is a key differentiator — clients only pay for what they actually use.

Vs. Competitors | A typical ecommerce operator might spend $200–$400/month across 5–6 tools. Your platform aims to replace all of that for $49–$129/month — a clear, quantifiable saving.

Key Risks & Mitigations

Risk | Mitigation
Client churns after free trial | Ensure strong onboarding, fast value delivery, and check-in calls in first 30 days
Token pricing confuses clients | Always show token equivalent in dollar value. Provide clear usage estimators.
Building apps takes too much time | Templatize common app types. Standardize components. Hire a developer at 20+ clients.
Competitor copies the model | Build strong client relationships. Network effects and switching costs protect you.
Technical debt grows fast | Invest in clean architecture from day one. Use proven frameworks (Next.js, Supabase).

VISION & LONG-TERM OPPORTUNITY

We are building in the most significant moment of software industry disruption since the cloud. Traditional SaaS valuations are collapsing because the market is pricing in the obsolescence of pre-built, rigid software. The winners of the next decade will not sell feature sets — they will sell foundations and the capabilities that let customers build their own software. Business OS is that foundation.

Business OS sits at the intersection of three compounding moats: a data moat (every prompt makes the AI smarter), a switching cost moat (clients build their entire operation on the platform), and a network moat (similar-industry clients make the platform better for each other). Unlike traditional SaaS whose value is static, Business OS grows exponentially more valuable with every client added.

Milestone | Target
Year 1 Goal | 50 active clients, $4,500 MRR, proven product-market fit
Year 2 Goal | 200+ clients, $20,000+ MRR, first team member hired
Year 3 Goal | Agency network, $100K+ ARR, self-serve app marketplace
Ultimate Vision | The leading Prompted Personalized Software platform for non-technical entrepreneurs — the operating system any business owner reaches for first

"The next decade will be less 'implement software' — more 'build software.' Business OS is the platform that makes that possible for everyone."

WHY NOW — THE PPS MOMENT

💡  The Era of Prompted Personalized SoftwareFor 50 years, businesses adapted their processes to fit rigid software — this is known as Business Process Reengineering (BPR). We are now entering the era of Prompted Personalized Software (PPS): software that adapts to the customer's process, built through natural language, deployed instantly. Business OS is built entirely around this principle.

The convergence of several forces in 2024–2025 created a narrow window of opportunity that will rapidly close as incumbents react. Business OS is positioned to capture this moment:

Market Force | Why It Matters
AI code generation quality crossed the threshold | For the first time, AI-generated code is production-grade, contextually aware, and deployable without engineering review — making prompt-to-product viable for real businesses.
"Vibe coding" entered mainstream business vocabulary | Non-technical founders are already experimenting with AI tools to build software. The behavior exists — it just lacks a structured, safe, business-grade platform to run on.
Traditional SaaS valuations are collapsing | The market is pricing in the obsolescence of pre-built rigid software. The winners of the next decade will sell foundations and capabilities, not feature sets. Business OS is that foundation.
Cloud infrastructure commoditized | GCP and AWS have reached the abstraction maturity point where a platform can reliably manage deployments on behalf of non-technical users — something that wasn't viable five years ago.
WhatsApp Business API reached maturity in LATAM | Latin America is the world's most WhatsApp-native commerce market. The API infrastructure is now stable, affordable, and officially supported — opening a communication layer that competitors have ignored.
Non-technical founders are the fastest-growing entrepreneur segment | Shopify proved the demand. Business OS takes it further: not just a store, but an entire business operating system built through conversation.
No more 6–12 month build queues | Businesses are exhausted by long implementation cycles, paying for 90% of features they never use, and changing their internal processes to fit someone else's software. The market is ready for the alternative.

THE FOUNDATION LAYER — OUR REAL MOAT

The post-PPS insight that most competitors will miss: the value is not in the features — it is in the foundation. Business OS ships a foundation layer with critical capabilities baked in that would take an engineering team 12–18 months to build from scratch. Every app a client builds or customizes stands on this foundation — instantly secure, compliant, and deployed.

Foundation Capability | What It Does | Time to Build From Scratch
Multi-tenant Auth & Permissions | Secure, isolated client workspaces with role-based access — no client ever sees another's data | 2–3 months
Cloud Deployment Pipeline | One-click deploy to GCP or AWS with zero DevOps knowledge — SSL, DNS, containers, all automated | 3–4 months
GitHub Integration Layer | Read, write, and version-control client codebases without exposing any developer tooling to the user | 1–2 months
Token Metering Engine | Real-time usage tracking, atomic debits, balance enforcement, and Stripe billing — all in one system | 2–3 months
Webhook & Integration Infrastructure | Pre-built connectors for GA4, WhatsApp, social platforms, payment processors — plug-and-play | 3–6 months
Real-Time Data Layer | Live order updates, WhatsApp message streaming, token balance — all synced across devices instantly | 1–2 months
AI Prompt Execution Engine | Reads codebase context, generates changes, produces plain-language diffs, manages version history | 4–6 months
TOTAL | What clients get for free by joining the platform | 16–26 months of engineering

🔒  Why This Is a MoatClients who build their operations on Business OS are not just using a SaaS product — they are building on infrastructure. Their apps, their customer data, their order history, their deployed code all live inside the platform. Leaving means rebuilding 16–26 months of engineering work. This switching cost compounds with every app built and every month of operation.

ANTI-FEATURES — WHAT WE DELIBERATELY DON'T DO

Traditional software forces businesses to pay for features they never use, implement processes they don't need, and hire consultants to make it work. Business OS is designed around the opposite philosophy: clients build exactly what their business needs, nothing more, and pay only for what runs.

Traditional SaaS | Business OS
❌  Pay for 50 features, use 5 | ✅  Pay only for what your business actually runs
❌  6–12 month implementation queues | ✅  Live in under 5 minutes — onboard in one session
❌  18-month change management cycles | ✅  Describe a change in one sentence — deployed today
❌  Adapt your process to fit the software | ✅  Software adapts to your process, built by prompting
❌  Engineering team required for customization | ✅  Business team builds and improves — no code needed
❌  Locked into the vendor's feature roadmap | ✅  Build exactly what your business needs, when you need it
❌  Massive per-seat pricing as you grow | ✅  Token-based — pay for usage, not headcount
❌  90% of features collecting dust | ✅  Every module you pay for is one you chose to build

COMPOUNDING MOAT — WHY WE GROW STRONGER OVER TIME

Unlike traditional SaaS products whose value is static (you pay for the same features whether you have 10 or 10,000 clients), Business OS becomes more valuable with every client added. Three compounding forces drive this:

Moat Type | How It Works | Effect Over Time
🧠  Data Moat | Every prompt submitted, every deployment made, and every client interaction trains a richer understanding of what non-technical business owners actually need to build. | AI suggestions become more accurate. Prompt-to-code quality improves. The platform anticipates needs before clients articulate them. New clients benefit from the collective intelligence of all prior usage.
🔒  Switching Cost Moat | Once a client's orders, CRM, inventory, WhatsApp inbox, deployed apps, and analytics all live inside Business OS, leaving means rebuilding their entire operational infrastructure. | Net revenue retention exceeds 120% — clients expand usage faster than they churn. The platform becomes load-bearing infrastructure, not a software subscription.
🌐  Network Moat | Anonymized usage patterns from similar industry clients improve the prompt-to-code quality for everyone in that category. A bakery benefits from what 50 other bakeries have already built. | Industry-specific module libraries emerge organically. Vertical communities form. The platform becomes the standard operating system for specific business types.

📈  The Compounding EffectA traditional SaaS product with 1,000 clients is 1,000x a single-client product. Business OS with 1,000 clients is exponentially more valuable than 1,000x a single-client product — because every client's usage makes the platform smarter, stickier, and harder to replicate. This is why the winners in the PPS era will be nearly impossible to displace once they reach critical mass.

PROMPT STUDIO MARKETPLACE — YEAR 2 OPPORTUNITY

The Prompt Studio (App Builder) is designed to be the core of the platform. As clients build and deploy apps through prompts, a natural ecosystem emerges: apps built for one business type are immediately useful to hundreds of similar businesses. In Year 2, we will open a Marketplace where clients can share, sell, or license the apps they have built.

Question | Answer
What is the Marketplace? | A curated directory of apps and modules built by the Business OS community — searchable by industry, function, and price. Any client can publish their apps for others to install with one click.
Who publishes apps? | Power users and agencies who build sophisticated solutions on the platform. Also the Business OS team, who will publish official first-party module templates.
How does monetization work? | App publishers set a one-time or monthly price. Business OS takes a 20–30% platform fee on every transaction, creating a new revenue stream with zero marginal cost.
How does this compound the moat? | The more apps in the Marketplace, the more valuable the platform becomes to new clients. It creates a flywheel: more clients → more apps built → more Marketplace listings → more new clients attracted.
What is the Year 2 target? | 50+ apps listed, 20% of clients using at least one Marketplace app, $15K–$30K in Marketplace GMV per month by end of Year 2.
Industry verticals to seed first | Restaurant operations, boutique retail, coaching & consulting, service businesses, ecommerce — the five highest-density client segments in the initial market.

🚀  Why Accelerate This to Year 2The PPS wave is moving fast. If Business OS establishes a Marketplace before competitors recognize the opportunity, it creates a winner-takes-most dynamic in each vertical. The first platform with 50+ restaurant apps becomes the default OS for restaurant businesses — and that position is nearly impossible to displace.

PRICING MODEL

The platform uses a subscription-first token model — clients subscribe to a monthly plan that includes a base token allotment, then purchase additional tokens as needed. All plans include a 14-day free trial with no credit card required.

🎁  14-Day Free Trial  —  No credit card requiredNew clients get full access to their chosen plan for 14 days. All apps, all features, all tokens included. Cancel anytime.

Token Top-Up Packs

When clients run low on tokens, they can purchase additional packs at any time without changing their subscription. Top-up rates decrease at higher plan tiers.

Pack | Tokens | Price | Cost per Token
Small | 5,000 tokens | $30 | $0.006 / token
Medium | 15,000 tokens | $75 | $0.005 / token
Large | 50,000 tokens | $200 | $0.004 / token
XL Bundle | 150,000 tokens | $525 | $0.0035 / token
On-Demand | Any amount | Pay-per-token | $0.09 / token

⚡  On-Demand Token Consumption  —  $0.09 / tokenNo subscription required. Clients pay $0.09 per token consumed, billed automatically at the end of each billing cycle. Ideal for clients who want to explore the platform before committing to a plan, or who have very low and unpredictable usage. No monthly commitment, no upfront purchase — tokens are metered in real time and charged only when used.Note: On-demand rate ($0.09/token) is 15× higher than the XL Bundle rate ($0.0035/token). Clients with regular usage save significantly by subscribing.

Token Cost Reference — Per App Action

This table helps clients estimate how many tokens they will use per month, and helps you explain the token model during sales conversations.

App Action | Tokens Used | Starter (10K/mo) | Pro (30K/mo)
Order sync (per batch of 50 orders) | 10 tokens | ~100 syncs/mo | ~300 syncs/mo
Product update (per product) | 3 tokens | ~3,300 updates/mo | ~10,000 updates/mo
Sales report (weekly) | 25 tokens | ~400 reports/mo | ~1,200 reports/mo
Email automation (per email sent) | 3 tokens | ~3,300 emails/mo | ~10,000 emails/mo
AI product description (per item) | 15 tokens | ~666 descriptions/mo | ~2,000 descriptions/mo
Customer segmentation analysis | 50 tokens | ~200 analyses/mo | ~600 analyses/mo
Inventory alert check (daily) | 5 tokens | ~2,000 checks/mo | ~6,000 checks/mo

App Build Service Pricing

In addition to subscriptions, clients can commission custom apps built specifically for their business. These are one-time fees, separate from the token subscription.

App Complexity | What's Included | Price (One-Time)
Simple App | Single-function app using existing platform components (e.g. basic order tracker, product lister) | $500 – $900
Standard App | Multi-function app with custom logic, 1-2 integrations (e.g. Order Sync + Notification combo) | $1,000 – $1,800
Advanced App | Complex workflows, 3+ integrations, custom UI, data processing (e.g. full inventory system) | $2,000 – $3,500
Enterprise Custom | Fully bespoke app, white-labeled, with dedicated support and documentation | From $4,000

Pricing Strategy & Rationale

Principle | Rationale
Subscription anchors MRR | Monthly plans guarantee predictable recurring revenue regardless of how many tokens each client burns.
Tokens drive engagement | Usage-based top-ups mean active clients naturally spend more — your revenue scales with their success.
14-day trial reduces friction | No credit card required lowers the barrier to onboarding. Clients experience value before committing.
3 tiers capture 3 buyer types | Starter for budget-conscious new sellers, Pro for growing stores, Enterprise for scaling or agency use.
Volume discounts incentivize upgrades | Top-up rates drop as plan tier rises — this rewards loyalty and nudges clients toward higher plans.
App builds are a profit center | One-time build fees are high-margin revenue that also lock clients deeper into the ecosystem.

PRODUCT FEATURES

The platform is designed as a complete Business Operating System for non-technical entrepreneurs. After selecting a plan, every client gets access to a unified environment where they can build, deploy, manage, and grow their online business entirely through natural language prompts — no coding required. Below is a full breakdown of each module.

🚀App Builder | 📊Analytics | 🛒Unified Sales | 📣Advertising | 💬WhatsApp | ☁️Cloud Mgmt

☁️  MODULE 1 — Onboarding & Cloud SetupConnect your existing infrastructure in minutes. No DevOps knowledge needed.

The first thing a new client does after signing up is complete a guided onboarding flow. This connects their existing cloud accounts, code repositories, and business tools to the platform so everything is accessible from one place.

Feature | Description
Guided Onboarding Wizard | Step-by-step setup assistant walks the client through connecting all their accounts. Each step is explained in plain language with visual cues.
GCP Integration | Connect Google Cloud Platform projects. The platform can read, deploy, and manage cloud resources (Cloud Run, Cloud Storage, Firebase) on behalf of the client.
AWS Integration | Connect Amazon Web Services accounts via IAM role. Supports EC2, S3, Lambda, and RDS. Future-proof for clients already using AWS infrastructure.
GitHub Repository Sync | Connect one or more GitHub repositories. The platform reads existing code and uses it as the base when clients request new features or improvements via prompts.
Custom Domain Setup | Clients can connect their own domain and the platform handles DNS routing, SSL certificates, and deployment — entirely automatic.
Environment Management | Clients can toggle between staging and production environments from the dashboard. No terminal access required.
Integration Health Dashboard | Real-time status panel showing which integrations are active, any errors, and last sync time for each connected service.

💡  Suggested Future IntegrationAzure (Microsoft cloud) as a third cloud option — many enterprise and Latin American companies use Azure. Also Cloudflare for CDN and DNS management, and Vercel/Netlify for frontend-only deployments.

🤖  MODULE 2 — Prompt Studio (Prompt-to-Product)Build, improve, and deploy features just by describing what you want.

This is the core differentiator of the platform. Clients describe what they want to build or change in plain language, and the AI generates the code, applies it to their repository, and deploys it — all with token consumption tracked transparently.

Feature | Description
Prompt Interface | A clean chat-like interface where clients type what they want to create or improve. Example: 'Add a product filter by category and price range to my store homepage.'
AI Code Generation | The platform reads the client's existing codebase from GitHub, understands the architecture, and generates code that fits seamlessly into their project.
One-Click Deploy | After generating a change, the client previews a before/after diff in plain language (not raw code), then clicks 'Deploy' to push to their cloud environment.
Module Library | Pre-built modules clients can activate with a prompt: product catalog, checkout flow, loyalty points, discount engine, customer portal, and more.
Version History | Every prompt-generated change is saved as a versioned snapshot. Clients can roll back to any previous version with one click.
Staging Preview | Before deploying to production, clients can preview changes on a staging URL to make sure everything looks right.
Prompt History & Favorites | All past prompts are saved. Clients can re-run, modify, or save favorite prompts as templates for repeated use.
AI Suggestions | Proactive suggestions from the AI: 'Your checkout page has a high drop-off rate. Want me to simplify the form?' — powered by analytics data.

Token Consumption — App Builder Actions

Action | Token Cost | Est. Monthly Usage
Generate a new feature / module (simple) | 50–150 tokens | ~10–20 builds/mo
Generate a new feature / module (complex) | 200–500 tokens | ~5–10 builds/mo
Apply & deploy a generated change | 25 tokens | Per deployment
Roll back to a previous version | 10 tokens | Per rollback
Read and index a GitHub repository | 30–100 tokens | Once per sync
AI suggestion (proactive) | 5 tokens | Per suggestion shown

Recommended Token Packages for App Builder Usage

Given the token intensity of the App Builder module, clients who use it regularly should be guided toward higher token packages. Below are the recommended packages with the updated pricing structure including volume discounts down to $0.05/token.

Package | Tokens | Price | Cost/Token | Best For
Starter Pack | 5,000 | $30 | $0.006 | Light users
Growth Pack | 15,000 | $75 | $0.005 | Regular builders
Scale Pack | 50,000 | $200 | $0.004 | Active developers
Pro Builder | 150,000 | $525 | $0.0035 | Power users
Enterprise XL | 500,000 | $1,500 | $0.003 | Agencies / teams
Ultra Bundle | 1,000,000 | $2,500 | $0.0025 | White-label resellers
On-Demand | Any amount | Pay-as-you-go | $0.09 | No-plan clients

💡  Pricing Strategy NoteThe new Ultra Bundle at $0.0025/token and Enterprise XL at $0.003/token extend the volume discount ladder down to $0.05/token equivalent for the largest buyers. This creates a natural upsell path: clients who build heavily will quickly see that buying larger packs saves them significantly vs on-demand pricing.

📊  MODULE 3 — Analytics & InsightsKnow exactly how your business is performing. All data in one dashboard.

Non-technical business owners often fly blind — they have data trapped in separate tools with no unified view. This module connects all analytics sources into a single, easy-to-read intelligence dashboard.

Feature | Description
Google Analytics Integration | Connect GA4 to pull website traffic, session data, conversion rates, and user behavior directly into the platform dashboard. No need to open GA separately.
